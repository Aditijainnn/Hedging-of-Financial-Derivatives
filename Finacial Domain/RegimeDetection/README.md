# Regime Detection using Kmeans
 
This repository shows a simple example of how to detect regime changes for financial data.
The idea of regime detection is to identify what phase/regime of the market we are in before we apply any trading strategy.

We apply the K-means clustering method. We use the elbow method to identify the optimal number of regimes that should be used.
